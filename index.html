      <p class="ex1">There is a driver to find cleaner sources to replace fossil fuels. Air-breathing electric propulsion systems (ABEP) operate on atmospheric particles, providing clean propulsion. That raises the question of whether ABEP is the next step in creating a sustainable future, replacing other propulsion systems. This article investigates the benefits ABEP provides, operational orbit, and looks at current research. It was found that ABEP outperforms other propulsion systems in very low earth orbit, providing lower launch costs and increasing life span. Still, its applications are limited as it relies on atmospheric gas as a propellant. Current testing, such as the AETHER project's successful model ignition and the DISCOVERER project's aerodynamic altitude control technology, shows advances in the technology but also suggests that more research needs to be done before ABEP is fully viable. Although ABEP can not replace conventional propulsion, it is a step in the right direction for the industry.</p>

      <h3 id="Introduction"; style="font-family: georgia;">Introduction</h3>

        <p class="ex1">In a world where sustainability is of major importance, the push for industries to reduce their carbon footprint and move towards reusable energy is ever prevalent. Chemical propulsion systems have traditionally been the most common propulsion type, however in recent years there has been a notable increase in the use of electric propulsion. This presents the question, could air-breathing electric propulsion systems be the next logical step in creating a sustainable future? In this article, I investigate current research, examine the benefits of ABEP, and investigate the effects of very low Earth orbit.</p>

      <h4 class="ml">What is ABEP?</h4>

      <p class="ex1">Air-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) captures residue particles from the atmosphere to be ionized, accelerated, and ejected, creating thrust <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.11.011">(Tisaev,M., et al., 2022)</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s44205-022-00024-9">(Andreussi, T., Ferrato, E. and Giannetti, V, 2022).</a> ABEP would operate at very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which is approximately between 100km and 450km but can vary depending on the source/study.</p>
<br>
      
      <h4 class="ml">Current use and testing of ABEP</h4>

      <p class="ex1">Research has been done on ABPS around the world. The 2017 SITAEL AETHER project successfully ignited a thruster with a generated flow <a href="https://aether-h2020.eu/">(AETHER Project, 2023)</a> and the DISCOVERER project led by the University of Manchester designed aerodynamic altitude control technology to correct satellite orientation changed by atmospheric conditions. They also investigated different aerodynamic coatings to minimise drag and reduce erosion and tested it on the exterior of the International Space Station (on the MISSE exposure facility) to assess the material’s performance long term. A spin-off company (CASA Space Technologies Ltd) was formed in May 2024 to profit from the coting for future VLEO satellites <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/impacts/very-low-earth-orbits-vleo-satellites-impacts-from-the-discoverer">(Research Explorer The University of Manchester, 2017).</a></p>
<br>
      
      <h4 class="ml">ABEP Benefits</h4>

      <p class="ex1">ABEP would allow low-orbiting satellites to run with no onboard propellant, therefore lightening the payload and increasing its life span. Electric propulsion tends to have a high specific impulse (engine efficiency), and low thrust profile (low thrust but high propellant exit velocity <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-91360-7.00001-x">(Matloff, G. and Gerrish, H., 2023)</a> which, for very low Earth orbit, is great for drag compensation. The thrust produced by ABEP could potentially counteract atmospheric drag, preventing rapid orbital decay and allowing the satellite to orbit at a lower altitude than previously possible. All these factors result in better resolution for weather satellites, offering opportunities for increasing the analysis of the climate and monitoring the effects of climate change. It also allows the collection of data in areas such as radiation, gravitational, and magnetic fields to promote improvements in telecommunication satellites <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.11.011">(Tisaev,M., et al., 2022).</a> In addition, the development of satellites and probes with this advanced form of propulsion could provide better opportunities for studying other planets within our solar system, allowing us to better understand other environments.</p>
<br>
      <h4 class="ml">Operating at Very Low Earth Orbit</h4>

      <p class="ex1">The altitude range for the ABEP is 150km – 250km. The lower limit is due to the drag increasing exponentially, causing a larger power requirement that is no longer viable to sustain. The number of atmospheric gas particles restricts the upper limit as limited propellant collection causes a decrease in thrust produced. As shown in Figure 1 (Romano et al., 2022), the dominant gas in VLEO is N2, and atomic oxygen (AO) at this altitude; the power needed to ionize the gas and a lower ionization efficiency, due to other present gas species, are limiting factors and would need to be considered when designing the system.</p>

<br>
      <h4 class="ml">The effects of VLEO</h4>

      <p class="ex1">VLEO is a non-uniform environment due to factors like solar activity (e.g. UV or X-ray flares). This can cause a variation in drag, altering the thrust requirements and propellant composition, affecting power requirements <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12567-022-00452-1">(Romano,F., et al., 2022).</a> Satellites currently do not often operate in very low orbit, mainly due to atmospheric gas residue. Increased drag levels on the satellites can be counteracted with increased power. If the power sources are from solar panels, raising the power requires an increase in solar panels' surface arrears, which increases the drag and the power required. A larger gas intake arrear for ABPS would increase the mass flow rate to the thrusters and could decrease the power requirements. Unfortunately, this could increase the drag and increase the power yet again. Research is currently being done into increasing ABPS thrust performance to overcome the drag without increasing surface area. The atmosphere at very low orbit interacts with the surface of the satellite, causing increased aerodynamic forces, torque, and atomic oxygen erosion. This creates further challenges in the design process as the effects of the above-mentioned are difficult to predict <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s44205-022-00024-9">(Andreussi, T., Ferrato, E., and Giannetti, V., 2022).</a></p>
      <p class="ex1">Although there is a lot to consider when designing a satellite that will operate in VLEO, reduced radioactivity, ease of end-of-life disposal, increased resolution, and ease of orbital access because of less debris are all major benefits that makes the challenge of VLEO worth the work <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s44205-022-00009-8">(Crandall, p. and Wirz, R.E., 2022).</a></p>
<br>
      <h4 class="ml">Conclusion</h4>

      <p class="ex1">The article investigates whether ABEP is the next step in creating a sustainable future, replacing other propulsion systems. ABPS is unlikely to replace most electric and chemical propulsion in satellites, but ABPS can fill the VLEO space in the market, overcoming the barrier that atmospheric drag has created for normal electric and chemical propulsion. The possibility of increased lifespan, lower launch cost, higher resolution of data, easier orbital access, and overcoming orbital decay are all major benefits of ABPS. ABPS is a step in the right direction to create a more stainable future as it uses a renewable fuel source; however, above VLEO, ABPS would not outperform electric or chemical propulsion systems, so a sustainable option for these still needs to be investigated. Operating in VLEO also comes with its challenges, such as atmospheric drag, increased aerodynamic forces, torque and atomic oxygen erosion. More research needs to be done into overcoming these issues, but with enough funding and research, viable solutions can be found.</p>
