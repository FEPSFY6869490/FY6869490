      <p class="ex1">There is a driver to find cleaner sources to replace fossil fuels. Air-breathing electric propulsion systems (ABEP) operate on atmospheric particles, providing clean propulsion. That raises the question of whether ABEP is the next step in creating a sustainable future, replacing other propulsion systems. This article investigates the benefits ABEP provides, operational orbit, and looks at current research. It was found that ABEP outperforms other propulsion systems in very low earth orbit, providing lower launch costs and increasing life span. Still, its applications are limited as it relies on atmospheric gas as a propellant. Current testing, such as the AETHER project's successful model ignition and the DISCOVERER project's aerodynamic altitude control technology, shows advances in the technology but also suggests that more research needs to be done before ABEP is fully viable. Although ABEP can not replace conventional propulsion, it is a step in the right direction for the industry.</p>

      <h3 id="Introduction"; style="font-family: georgia;">Introduction</h3>

        <p class="ex1">In a world where sustainability is of major importance, the push for industries to reduce their carbon footprint and move towards reusable energy is ever prevalent. Chemical propulsion systems have traditionally been the most common propulsion type, however in recent years there has been a notable increase in the use of electric propulsion. This presents the question, could air-breathing electric propulsion systems be the next logical step in creating a sustainable future? In this article, I investigate current research, examine the benefits of ABEP, and investigate the effects of very low Earth orbit.</p>

      <h4 style="font-family: georgia;">What is ABEP?</h4>

      <p class="ex1">Air-breathing electric propulsion (ABEP) captures residue particles from the atmosphere to be ionized, accelerated, and ejected, creating thrust <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2021.11.011">(Tisaev, M,2022)</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s44205-022-00024-9">(Andreussi, T., Ferrato, E. and Giannetti, V, 2022).</a> ABEP would operate at very low Earth orbit (VLEO), which is approximately between 100km and 450km but can vary depending on the source/study.</p>

      <h4 style="font-family: georgia;">Current use and testing of ABEP</h4>

      <p class="ex1">Research has been done on ABPS around the world. The 2017 SITAEL AETHER project successfully ignited a thruster with a generated flow (AETHER Project, 2023) and the DISCOVERER project led by the University of Manchester designed aerodynamic altitude control technology to correct satellite orientation changed by atmospheric conditions. They also investigated different aerodynamic coatings to minimise drag and reduce erosion and tested it on the exterior of the International Space Station (on the MISSE exposure facility) to assess the materialâ€™s performance long term. A spin-off company (CASA Space Technologies Ltd) was formed in May 2024 to profit from the coting for future VLEO satellites. (Research Explorer The University of Manchester, 2017)</p>
